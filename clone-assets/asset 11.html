Their talents as an individual designer didn’t translate into management.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy pored over leadership books like Michael Porter’s \u003cem\u003eCompetitive Strategy\u003c/em\u003e and Dale Carnegie’s classic \u003cem\u003eHow to Win Friends and Influence People \u003c/em\u003eto fill gaps in his knowledge.

Design reviews can happen at a number of different points in a project. It’s often helpful to do one early on so the designer can get fresh perspectives before investing too much time in an idea that may be misguided. The midway point and toward the end of a project are also natural times to get additional inputs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever use a design review as a big reveal of project. If you wait until you have everything polished, you’ll be too invested to accept the feedback you’re given.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesign reviews are a great opportunity to bring in experts from other teams to make the work better. Colleagues from support, engineering, product management, QA, legal, marketing, or even an executive may have a new perspective to help you see the problem differently.

This is exactly what a team from Stanford’s d.school set out to accomplish as a project for the class Design for Extreme Affordability (often known just as “Extreme”).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe team ended up with a novel, innovative solution—but they never would’ve arrived there if they remained within the bubble of Stanford’s campus. They needed empathy to see the problem clearly from the perspective of hospital staff, doctors, and most importantly, parents of the child in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitially, the design team thought redesigning existing hospital incubators to be simpler and more cost effective would be the easiest solution. But when team member \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/liang_linus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eLinus Liang\u003c/a\u003e toured a hospital in Nepal, he noticed something strange—the incubators were sitting empty. After interviewing a doctor about this, he learned that many homes where these babies were born were 30 or more miles away on rough rural roads, and that the parents faced the fight for their babies’ lives at home, without much hope of making it to a hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Extreme team used this insight to inform their decisions about the product’s direction. Instead of a cheaper incubator (the initial concept, but likely ineffective given the evidence) they decided to design something to help babies at home: a portable incubator, much like a tiny, heated sleeping bag, which they named \u003ca href=\"http://embraceglobal.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eEmbrace\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"quote share-el\"\u003e\n\u003chr class=\"vert\" /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e    \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/tceb62\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmpathy is at the heart of design\u003c/strong\u003e.

Whatever your methods include, a good empathy study will give you new perspectives on the lives of your users—including the challenges they face, the things that keep them up at night, and the moments that delight them. Having this empathy can give you the insights you need to solve hard, worthwhile problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout empathy, IDEO would not have been able to help Bank of America create a product that helped their financially strained customers feel empowered about saving money.

The only life-sustaining planet in our solar system is dwarfed by the vast emptiness of space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the photograph from this event, which became known as “Earthrise,” the Apollo 8 astronauts inadvertently sparked a spontaneous reframing of the environmental problems threatening our planet.

In the early days, a mail delivery solution may have worked, but over time Netflix developed the streaming services that helped make them so popular.

Add in original content, and now Caroline can binge-watch \u003cem\u003eHouse of Cards\u003c/em\u003e while her daughter sleeps.

Over the phone, Doug is a kind, affable midwesterner—the sort of guy you imagine it would be fun to go to a Milwaukee Brewers game with. But beneath his unassuming presence is a formidable design mind with over 25 years of experience at GE Healthcare. First as a principal designer and now Innovation Architect, Doug has helped develop medical equipment such as MRI and CT scanners for one of the world’s largest corporations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jajduxPD6H4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eIn 2008, Doug ran into a problem\u003c/a\u003e. He was at a hospital where one of his new MRI machines had recently been installed. The machine had won a prestigious industrial design award and Doug was eager to see the machine in situ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he had much of a chance to ask the technician about the machine, he was asked to step outside of the room, as a patient was scheduled to come in for an appointment. What he witnessed in the hallway changed the course of his career and helped him reframe the MRI user experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young family walked in, their 7-year-old daughter obviously distressed. As the family got closer, Doug could see that she was weeping. The father leaned over and said, “Remember, we talked about this, you can be brave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug peered into the room where the young girl was about to enter the scanner. Crouching down, he had a new perspective on the room—and on the machine that he had so proudly designed. He could immediately understand why the girl was terrified: warning stickers plastered the machine and yellow and black tape marked the floor like a crash-test scene. The machine itself looked like a beige “brick with a hole in it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven this new perspective, it’s no mystery why many children have to be sedated to get MRI or CT scans. Everything about the experience can be frightening, from the room and the machine to the claustrophobia and loud noises. Doug came away with a new mission: to understand how GE might redesign this experience for children so that it’s a positive experience and not something to be dreaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug’s boss recommended he attend an executive education workshop at the d.school at Stanford to get the Design Thinking toolkit and help him solve this big, emotionally-charged problem.

The only way you’ll learn which technique works best for you is to experiment with a few.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll remember from our introduction that Alex Osborn sets 2 guidelines for a successful brainstorm:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDefer judgement\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReach for quantity\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile these are fundamentally important, there are a few additional guidelines that will make your brainstorm more successful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBefore the brainstorm\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA key part of the brainstorming process is the facilitator—someone who will lead the session, keep track of time, and set up the space for the group. This facilitator can also make sure that the group comes prepared with a mission framed by problem statements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[inv-soundcloud id=“284352899”]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSet a mission\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour brainstorming session should have a clear goal. What problem(s) are you surfacing ideas for? What is the best method for coming up with this goal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecall that Stanford’s d.school design thinking framework (below) alternates between generative (flaring) and selective (focusing) phases. As you \u003ca href=\"https://www.designbetter.co/design-thinking/empathize/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eEmpathize\u003c/a\u003e, you gather data and stories from your users, generating insights and flaring out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you begin to synthesize that information and come closer to \u003ca href=\"https://www.designbetter.co/design-thinking/define/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eDefining\u003c/a\u003e your point of view (POV), you become selective about the solution space you will pursue, and you focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"image share-el\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/designco-web-assets/uploads/2017/06/123fb_v4.png\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFigure 3: An illustration of the design thinking process, showing flaring and focusing phases, from the Stanford d.school’s visual resource guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the current Ideate phase, you flare out again as you generate a multitude of ideas and select promising solutions for \u003ca href=\"https://www.designbetter.co/design-thinking/prototype/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ePrototyping\u003c/a\u003e. Doing this helps your team step beyond obvious solutions, harness the collective creativity of the team, and discover new and unexpected areas to explore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do you go about generating those ideas? The POV that you generated in the Define phase is a great platform to help start the process. Using your POV problem statement, come up with “How might we … ?” topics that are subsets of the entire problem. If your POV is well constructed, these topics should fall naturally out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, let’s go back to Doug Dietz’s POV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e“We met scared families trying not to fall apart during the hospital visit. We were amazed to realize that they have to sedate 80% of the children between 3 and 8 years old, in order to have them be scanned. It would change the world if we could capitalize on the child’s amazing imagination to transform the radiology experience into a positive, memorable adventure.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that POV, you can pretty easily come up with problem statements like “How might we make the MRI scanner a more imaginative space?” or “How can we reduce anxiety before appointments by sparking children’s imaginations?” With these topics, you can then set up brainstorming sessions to surface a lot of ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSet up the space\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a good brainstorm to happen, the energy in the room needs to be right. First, pick a space that has large whiteboards or room on a wall to set up poster-sized \u003ca href=\"http://www.post-it.com/3M/en_US/post-it/products/~/Post-it-Products/Easel-Pads/?N=4327+5927574+3294529207+3294857497\u0026amp;rt=r3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eEasel Pads\u003c/a\u003e. The room should also be somewhat enclosed if there is a worry about bothering other teams (brainstorming can get boisterous)—but there are alternate techniques for a quiet brainstorm, which we’ll get to a little later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGet into the right headspace\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re coming into a brainstorming session from individual work, it can be a little jarring to adopt a collaborative mindset—and hard to ramp up your energy level accordingly. The facilitator should spend a few minutes getting everyone acclimated. There are quick, improv-based techniques for this, like \u003ca href=\"http://www.bbbpress.com/2015/11/drama-game-sound-ball/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eSound Ball\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"http://improvencyclopedia.org/games//Knife_Baby_Angry_Cat.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eKnife, Baby, and Angry Cat\u003c/a\u003e.

Setting a time limit for each topic is a good idea (15–20 minutes works well, depending on how many topics you need to cover). You can also set a goal for the number of ideas per topic (e.g., 100 ideas in 20 minutes). Use a \u003ca href=\"http://www.timetimer.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eTime Timer\u003c/a\u003e so everyone has a visual indicator and benefits from adrenaline-powered sprints as the time begins to run short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDuring the brainstorm\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the brainstorm kicks off, the moderator’s job is to keep the momentum going, stay on topic, and make sure all ideas are captured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlways say yes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo keep the energy high and the ideas flowing, a good brainstorm shares a lot in common with the improv technique of “Yes, and … ” When an idea is put forth, participants should be encouraged to build on it, putting a positive spin on the contribution. Critical energy can be diverted into productive ideation in this way. For example, “\u003cem\u003eYes\u003c/em\u003e, I like that idea, \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e we could go even further by … ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStay on topic\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the heated environment of a brainstorm, it’s easy to get sidetracked and start diving down rabbit holes that have no relation to the problem statement at hand. It’s important for the facilitator to gently guide participants back to the current topic. Sometimes this is best done by noting adjacent topics and mentioning that the group can come back to it later or during a future session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBe visual and headline\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne way to run a brainstorm is to have the facilitator serve as scribe, logging all the ideas as they come. Another is to arm the group with sticky notes and sharpies, so that they can walk up to the board, verbally share an idea, and put a summary of the idea on the board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither way, it’s important to be visual. Encourage quick sketches— these will help to clarify and group ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, ideas should be headlined as they are produced. A participant can say, “We could create a way for the user to leave feedback for us directly via a comment form,” which someone would then summarize as “Feedback comment form.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever method you choose, ideas should be shared one at a time. This allows the scribe to write them, or the participant to be heard as they post their idea to the board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAfter the brainstorm\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the brainstorm is finished and there are a hundred ideas on the board, it’s easy enough to give high fives all around and walk away without really having accomplished much. Leave a little time after the brainstorm to review and capture the ideas that were shared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNarrow down, but not too fast\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’ve run a productive brainstorm, you’ll likely have a lot of different ideas on the board—some funny, some weird, perhaps some verging on insane. It can be tempting to cut any idea that isn’t feasible, but by doing so you may be tripping up the ideation process. Sometimes good ideas can come from a place that initially seemed silly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, give the participants a way to select ideas across multiple criteria. One way to do this is to use color-coded sticky dots or pieces of colored Post-its. Each color can signify a person’s top choices in each category, such as the lowest hanging fruit, most delightful, or the long shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCapture and move to prototyping\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you’ve selected ideas in each category, carry them into prototyping, ensuring that you don’t walk away from the session with just the safest choice. Use a phone to photograph the whole board, and then extract the top ideas in a document which can be used to kick off the prototyping process (Google Docs is great for this).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrototyping is a flaring part of the design thinking process. Even if a selected idea is so crazy it doesn’t seem worthy of a test, figure out what’s attractive in that solution, and use that to inspire a prototype. The goal is to come into the \u003ca href=\"https://www.designbetter.co/design-thinking/prototype/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ePrototype\u003c/a\u003e phase with multiple solutions to build and then test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember that brainstorming is just 1 step in the process of coming up with a solution. In all likelihood, you won’t come out of a brainstorming session armed with the exact idea that you’ll bring to your users. But you will hopefully compile an overview of the conceptual landscape, gain a shared perspective on the problem with your team, or get key stakeholders to buy into the design process. All of these things will help seed the minds of your team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"protip share-el\"\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003ePro tip: brainstorming at IDEO\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"tw-copy\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter Macdonald has run countless brainstorms during his 23-year tenure at IDEO as a design lead. Peter says: “You can\u0026#8217;t have a good brainstorm without setting it up right—having everyone feeling safe and heard.

In that case, mindmaps are your friend! The concept is simple, but mindmaps can be a powerful way to move from conventional ideas to unpredictable, innovative ones. The following version of this technique is adapted from David and Tom Kelley’s \u003cem\u003eCreative Confidence\u003c/em\u003e. You can start with a problem statement like, “A better birthday party for a 1-year-old.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrite your topic or problem statement in the middle of a piece of paper, and circle it. Make connections to that central node, and write them down.

Hillis mentioned that he was going to create a startup, with the goal of building a parallel computer that had a million processors. In typical Feynman fashion, the physicist responded that it was “positively the dopiest idea I ever heard.” But he was intrigued, and by the end of lunch had agreed to spend the summer working at the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the first few months on the job, Feynman worked on the router circuits. These would allow the processors to communicate and were far more complex than the processors themselves. The routers—tasked with ferrying information from point to point—had to find a free path through a 20-dimensional traffic jam between the processors, or hold the message in a buffer until the path was clear. A critical question was whether the design had allowed for enough buffering to operate efficiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeynman began studying the circuit diagrams and was willing to listen to explanations of why things worked. But he far preferred to use pencil and paper to simulate the action of each circuit and figure out things for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeynman’s work on the routers helped the team discover the potential of the computer—which they had dubbed the Connection Machine—for complex numerical computing and physical simulation. This was useful for modeling things like the behavior of fluids and the simulation of artificial life, programs which other computers of that era were not designed to perform efficiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe team had initially assumed that their machine would not be capable of these types of number-crunching calculations, but Feynman argued that the assumption was worth challenging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo settle the argument and find out how well these computations would work in practice, Feynman had to create a prototype program to run. He was only really familiar with the programming language Basic, so he made up his own version of Basic that would run on the parallel processors. He would write the program, and then simulate it by hand to estimate how fast the Connection Machine could run it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeynman treated these challenges like a game, starting with very basic questions like, “What is the simplest example?” He would then continue to ask questions until he had boiled the problem down to something he thought he could solve—which he would attack with pencil on paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeynman’s contributions eventually helped the company become a leader in parallel computing, generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"image share-el\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/designco-web-assets/uploads/2017/06/CM-1_r_700w_v2.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFigure 1: A production version of the CM-1 Connection Machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Hillis reminisced about his work with Feynman, he realized that in almost everything they collaborated on, they were amateurs.

Design is more than color and form; \u003cstrong\u003edesign is the act of planning with the intention to serve others\u003c/strong\u003e. Under this definition, the borders of design stretch beyond a single team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEngineers, product managers, and researchers all have an important part to play in the design of a product. Their work, like ours, shapes the user experience. But despite shared interests, teams are often siloed by discipline, which makes collaboration and communication difficult, even dysfunctional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOrganizational design influences product design—\u003c/em\u003esignificantly\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003eIf the relationship between the people who make a product is broken, the product will be broken too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBroken teams, broken product\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere’s a scenario that plays out in companies far too often: Courtney and her team spent weeks perfecting the design of a new product. They presented the final concepts to stakeholders, got immediate sign off, then handed off their design files to Everett and his engineering team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the dashboard design was stunning, Everett’s team had to gut it because the data Courtney’s team wanted to display wasn’t actually available. They also had to throw out the account sign up design because the designers hadn’t included all the necessary fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Everett’s team continued to build the app, the distance between the intentions of designers and the execution of engineers widened. When Courtney finally got a peek at the app, she was horrified and said, “This looks nothing like the design we created!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked across the building to engineering and stormed into Everett’s office to demand an explanation. Everett, frustrated that he and his team weren’t consulted earlier, curtly explained the design concept was ignorant of engineering requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe relationship between design and engineering was already rocky—this wasn’t the first time they’d felt out of sync. Now it had gone from bad to worse, and the product was a reflection of their animosity. It was a mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike an episode of \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3jxWCJUPQQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eHBO’s Silicon Valley\u003c/a\u003e, this story may hit a little too close to home. Courtney and Everett are out of step, as their organization is operating with a handicap—they have a \u003cem\u003evertical\u003c/em\u003e relationship. Design, at the top of the process, passes work down to engineering to execute—engineers aren’t part of the problem solving phase. Subsequently, Courtney’s team missed key technical details and key parts of the design had to be scrapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVertical relationships also flow the other way—from engineering to design. Engineers rush to build a product’s infrastructure and pass it to designers for decoration afterwards. The results are equally disjointed, as buttons and type might look nice, but workflows built around database models instead of mental models leave users confused and frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth scenarios are broken.

Congregating regularly gave all designers the opportunity to discuss the overall design style of the company and keep everyone in sync.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBBC: Rotate teams\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe BBC, with more than 20,000 employees, lets employees work on a new team every year.

Drawn to design, he entered Stanford University in 1975, where he earned his master’s degree in Engineering/Product Design. In 1978, he founded the design firm that would become IDEO and, in that same year, began his teaching career at Stanford, receiving tenure in 1990. He also founded an early-stage venture-capital firm in 1984 called Onset, and was instrumental in starting a special effects firm called Edge Innovations, which creates unique Animatronics for the film industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelley was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering in 2000.
